# Combos

Combos are special attack animations which play when certain input sequences are met. Combos have the following data structure:

```
{
	["12"] = { Id = ##, Damage = ## },
    ...
}
```

The `Id` is the attack animation id which will play. `Damage` is the amount of damage dealt when this attack animation plays.
