# Dialogue Navigation

Dialogue text are found in `src/shared/Commu/`

# Text Files

All dialogue text are written in Inkle. Although the file extensions are `.txt`, [Rink](https://github.com/vlazed/rink) can recognize the ink structure.

Ink dialogue files can be placed anywhere. For consistency, we recommend placing them in the `src/shared/Commu` folder

To write new dialogue, go to the next section.
